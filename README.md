## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge definitely helped me implement a lot of different concepts that I have been struggling with. To be more specific, css positioning. This was amazing practice for me and in completing it I learned a lot.

### Continued development

I initially struggled with this challenge. I then implemented a mobile first approach and it helped me see things more clearly and eventually I managed to complete this challenge.
